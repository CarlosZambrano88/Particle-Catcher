# Particle-Catcher
Features - 5x5 square game grid + mouse interaction + UI + lives & score 
Challeneges - impementing mouse interaction with functions such as mouse.getpressed(); implementing images and text; and changing a variable real time in the UI 
Outcomes - The ideal outcome of this is to have a game with a visible UI, functioning game, and functioning lives and score. The minimum viable outcome would be to have the game working. UI is important, but what's the point of having frosting if there is no cake?

Milestones: 4 weeks 
Week 1 - complete digital rain and begin main game functionality 
Week 2 - complete/finish game functionality 
Week 3 - implement score and lives functionality 
Week 4 - Add UI visuals to make it look nice

This project is a game in which you need to click on the right squares, at the right time, before time runs out to win! You get 3 lives and the grid is a 5x5 square grid with a random colored square popping up in a random location. The square is a shade of either red, green, or blue. The player must press the right button on the mouse based on the color of the square. Users win the game by correctly clicking 30 squares before 30 seconds while having 3 lives.
